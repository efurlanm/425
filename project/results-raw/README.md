# Results

This directory contains a series of Notebooks used to generate the data analyzed in the work. For the results, the hyperparameters Nl (number of hidden layers) and Nle (number of neurons per hidden layer) were varied, as well as the number of CPs (Placement Points) for training. The implementations present in the directories were used to obtain the results.
