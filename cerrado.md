- Simulates the spread of fire throughout the biome three times a day
- It is the biome most affected by forest fires in all of South America
- Online system capable of predicting the spread of fires in almost real time
- Article in the journal Nature: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-30560-9
- Uses remote sensing images together with climate and relief data to simulate the spread of fire
- 89% success rate
- The spatial resolution is
    - 25 hectares for most of the biome
    - 0.04 hectares for nine Conservation Units
- The system automatically loads data that makes it possible to know
    - The ignition sources
    - The abundance of combustible material
    - The humidity of the vegetation and the probability of burning
- Given a given ignition source, the system can predict
    - The direction of fire spread
    - The duration of burning
    - The total area that could be burned
    - Biomass consumption
    - Resulting carbon dioxide COâ‚‚ emissions
- It incorporates climatic conditions and the effect of a series of anthropogenic factors, such as
    - Land zoning
    - Proximity to highways and urban areas
