## Links of interest

- [The Library of Celsus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Celsus): considered an architectural marvel, it was the third largest library in the Greco-Roman world, behind only those in Alexandria and Pergamum. Today located near the modern city of Selçuk in the province of Izmir in western Turkey, the building was commissioned in the 110s AD by a consul of the Roman Empire, Tiberius Julius Aquila Polemaeanus, as a funerary monument for his father, Tiberius Julius Celsus Polemaeanus, former proconsul of Asia.

- [Descriptive statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics): the process of using and analyzing a summary statistic that quantitatively describes characteristics of a collection of information.

- [Regression analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis): is a set of statistical processes to estimate the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables, and the most common form is linear regression, in which the line that best fits the data is found according to a specific mathematical criterion.
