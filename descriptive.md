# Descriptive statistics - some review points

*Last edited: 2023-09-27*

Measures of central tendency

- Mean: the sum of a variable's values divided by the total number of values
- Median: the middle value of a variable
- Mode: the value that occurs most often

Measures of Dispersion and Variability

- Standard Deviation: average distance that individual data points are from the mean
- Coefficient of Variation: how much variation occurs within your data set. The higher it is the more data points you need to collect to be confident that the sample is representative of the population. It can also be used to compare variation between data sets
- Variance (sÂ²): the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean
- Standard Error (SE): how closely your sample relates to the population
- Range: the highest and lowest value in a data set
- Percentile: represent position of a values in data set
- Quartiles: values that divide your data into quarters
- Skewness: measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean
- Kurtosis: is a measure of whether the data are heavy-tailed (profusion of outliers) or light-tailed (lack of outliers) relative to a normal distribution
- Correlation: echnique that can show whether and how strongly pairs of variables are related
